        As the resolution and quality of displays increase, efficient processing of the display output becomes even more important in a media system. Having a dedicated display processor that not only controls output to the screen but also enables the GPU to offload basic tasks such as multi-layer composition or image post-processing improves visual quality and reduces overall SoC power consumption.
