        Arm TrustZone technology is a System on Chip (SoC) and CPU system-wide approach to security. TrustZone is hardware-based security built into SoCs by semiconductor chip designers who want to provide secure end points and a device root of trust. The family of TrustZone technologies can be integrated into any Arm Cortex-A and the latest Cortex-M23 and Cortex-M33 based systems, from the smallest of microcontrollers, with TrustZone for Cortex-M processors, to high-performance applications processors, with TrustZone technology for Cortex-A processors.
        
        At the heart of the TrustZone approach is the concept of secure and non-secure worlds that are hardware separated, with non-secure software blocked from accessing secure resources directly. Within the processor, software either resides in the secure world or the non-secure world; a switch between these two worlds is accomplished via software referred to as the secure monitor (Cortex-A) or by the core logic (Cortex-M). This concept of secure (trusted) and non-secure (non-trusted) worlds extends beyond the processor to encompass memory, software, bus transactions, interrupts and peripherals within an SoC.
        An overview of TrustZone technology is presented on the diagram on the right: the two processor family profiles offer the same security concepts, but with a totally different implementation. TrustZone technology provides a foundation for system-wide security and the creation of a trusted platform. Any part of the system can be designed to be part of the secure world, including debug, peripherals, interrupts and memory. By creating a security subsystem, assets can be protected from software attacks and common hardware attacks.
